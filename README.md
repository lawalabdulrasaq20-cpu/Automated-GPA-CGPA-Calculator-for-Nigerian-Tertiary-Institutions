# Automated-GPA-CGPA-Calculator-for-Nigerian-Tertiary-Institutions
Design and implement a web-based academic result management system that allows students to enter their registered courses and corresponding units while the system automatically calculates GPA and CGPA using the Nigerian grading system. The platform reduces calculation errors, saves time, and helps students track academic performance efficiently.

The system aims to eliminate manual GPA computation, which remains common in many Nigerian institutions, and reduce stress associated with result estimation by students.

Core Functionalities
1. Course & Unit Entry

Students can:

Add courses per semester

Assign course units

Input grades (A–F)

Dynamic validation to prevent invalid entries

2. Nigerian Grading System
Grade	Score Range	Point
A	70 – 100	5
B	60 – 69	4
C	50 – 59	3
D	45 – 49	2
E	40 – 44	1
F	0 – 39	0
3. GPA Calculation

Formula:

GPA = Total Quality Points / Total Credit Units


Where:

Quality Points = Course Unit × Grade Point

4. CGPA Calculation

Automatically aggregates GPA across semesters:

CGPA = Total Cumulative Quality Points / Total Cumulative Units

5. Goal GPA & CGPA Tracking

Students can:

Set a target GPA or CGPA

See required performance to achieve the goal

Helps with academic planning and motivation

6. PDF Result Summary

Generate downloadable PDF containing:

Semester results

GPA & CGPA

Academic standing

Useful for printing and record-keeping

Why This System Works

Many Nigerian institutions still calculate results manually

Students struggle with estimating GPA and graduation outcomes

Reduces human error in grade computation

Offers instant academic feedback

Improves transparency and confidence in results
